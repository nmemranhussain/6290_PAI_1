# Regression Modeling with H2O: Applying GLM and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Predictive Accuracy  

### Basic Information

* **Person or organization developing model**: Patrick Hall, `jphall@gwu.edu` & N M Emran Hussain `nmemran.hussain@gwu.edu`
* **Model date**: June, 2025
* **Model version**: H20 3.46.0.7 version
* **License**: [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/nmemranhussain/RML_A_1_Group_11/blob/main/LICENSE)
* **Model implementation code**: [Assignment_1](https://github.com/nmemranhussain/6290_PAI_1/blob/main/Assignment_1_final.ipynb), [Assignment_2](https://github.com/nmemranhussain/6290_PAI_1/blob/main/Assignment_2_final.ipynb)

### Intended Use
* **Primary intended uses**: This project is designed as educational and practical exercises to explore supervised machine learning techniques—specifically, Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)—for solving regression problems using the H2O platform. The goal is to understand model formulation, data preprocessing, parameter tuning, model evaluation, and performance comparison. It serves as hands-on demonstrations of how to build predictive models on real-world tabular datasets, offering exposure to tools like H2O's Python interface, Colab integration, and model metrics such as RMSE and R². These projects are suitable for academic learning, prototyping predictive solutions, and developing foundational skills in automated machine learning systems.
* **Out-of-scope use cases**: This project is not intended for high-stakes, production-level deployment or decision-making in regulated or mission-critical environments (e.g., healthcare diagnostics, financial risk modeling, or autonomous systems). The models (GLM and ANN) are not intended for real-time, high-stakes automated decision-making without human oversight. Any use beyond an educational example is out-of-scope.
